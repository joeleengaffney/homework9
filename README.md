# Step 1 Simulate n = 64 Bernoulli random variable with p = 0.3 and calculate Ë†p. Calculate two types of 95% confidences as described above and check # whether they contain the true p.
# Step 2 Repeat Step 1 for m = 1000 times and check which type of 95 % confidence interval will at least cover the true p for more than 95 % of times.
# Step 3 Repeat Step 2 for 100 times. What conclusion will you make?
